This project simulates a robotic exploration mission on Mars, where a rover investigates five 
meteorite landing sites in the Syrtis Major region. The objective is to generate meteorite site data 
and calculate the time required to visit each site in sequence while accounting for travel and sampling
times. The project consists of two Python scripts that automate these tasks and provide a detailed log
of the rover's journey.

Step 1: Generate Meteorite Sites
Step 2: Calculate Travel Time

The output will detail each leg of the trip, including travel time and sampling time for each 
meteorite. The final summary will show the total number of legs and the total elapsed mission time.
